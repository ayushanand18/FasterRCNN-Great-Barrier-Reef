# FasterRCNN-Great-Barrier-Reef
he goal of creating a FastRCNN based object detection model was to accurately identify starfish in real-time, trained on underwater videos of coral reefs. Australia's stunningly beautiful Great Barrier Reef is the world’s largest coral reef and home to 1,500 species of fish, 400 species of corals, 130 species of sharks, rays, and a massive variety of other sea life. Unfortunately, the reef is under threat, in part because of the overpopulation of one particular starfish – the coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish (or COTS for short). The model can accurately identify COTS from video footage and output coordinates of a "bounding box" with the location of the COTS.
